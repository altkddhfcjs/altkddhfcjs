## Projects

### 3D Multi-Object Tracking  
**Nov. 2023 – Jun. 2024**, Chungnam National University  
Developed a 3D MOT system that tracks multiple objects in 3D space using data captured from multiple camera views. The system first performs 3D object detection, followed by coordinate-based tracking using only predicted 3D positions.  
**Skills**: Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence

### Multi-Camera Multi-Object Detection and Tracking Software  
**May 2023 – Dec. 2023**, Funded by ETRI  
Built a deep learning-based software pipeline for tracking multiple objects from road-side CCTV footage. Focused on scalable multi-camera fusion and real-time detection/tracking optimization.  
**Skills**: Computer Vision, PyTorch

### High-Precision Localization and Motion Reconstruction Software  
**May 2022 – Nov. 2022**, Funded by ETRI  
Developed a Re-Identification algorithm for consistent tracking of identical objects across multiple CCTV camera views.  
**Skills**: Python, Computer Vision, PyTorch

### Robust Feature Detection for High-Precision Motion Estimation  
**Apr. 2021 – Nov. 2021**, Funded by ETRI  
Researched robust feature extraction techniques to enable accurate motion estimation in multi-camera tracking environments.  
**Skills**: Python, Computer Vision, PyTorch
